# LearningPython
This is a set of code walk throughs that will expose you to some common functionality in Python.

Before you run the program, I suggest that you read the code first and write on a sheet of paper what you think the output will be. Then, rather than running the program out right step through the program line by line using the debugger.  This will not only help you learn and understand the code, but it will help you learn to use the debugger.

The code is primarily taken from the amazing tutorials of Derek Banas.

```Python
def learn(input): 
  if(input == maxEffort)
    return knowledge + gratification + pride + respect
  else
    return frustration + disappointment
```
